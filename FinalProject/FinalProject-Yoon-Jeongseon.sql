-- QUESTION 2:
-- Write a query which shows the complete list of last names from both the EMPLOYEE table
-- and STAFF table. Make sure your query is case insensitive (ie SMITH = Smith = smith).
-- Make sure names are not duplicated. We only want to see each name once in the result set.
-- Display the names with the initial character as a capital (ie: Smith, Jones, etc).
-- Output should be in ascending order (alphabetical order)
-- WHAT TO HAND IN: Provide your query. Provide the result set.

-- QUESTION 4:

-- QUESTION 5:
-- Write a query which looks at the EMPLOYEE table and, for each department, compares the
-- manager's total compensation (SALARY, BONUS and COMMISSION) to the top paid
-- employee's total compensation and displays output if the top paid employee in that
-- department makes within $10,000 in total compensation as compared to their manager.
-- The output should include department, manager's total compensation and top paid employee's total compensation
-- If a department has no non-managers - OR - has no manager, assume total compensation is 0
-- WHAT TO HAND IN: Provide your query. Provide the result set.
-- Q5 SOLUTION --
SELECT emp_top.workdept,
    NVL(mgr.totalCompensation, 0) AS "manager’s total compensation",
    emp_top.totalCompensation AS "employee’s total compensation"

-- QUESTION 6:
-- Write a query which looks across both the EMPLOYEE and STAFF table and 
-- returns the total "variable pay" (COMMISSION + BONUS) for each employee.
-- If an employee does not make either, the output should be 0
-- The output should include the employee's last name and total variable pay
-- The output should be ordered by a case insensitive view of their last name in alphabetical order
-- WHAT TO HAND IN: Provide your query. Provide the result set.
-- Q6 SOLUTION --

-- QUESTION 7:
-- Write a stored procedure for the EMPLOYEE table which takes, as input, an employee number
-- and a rating of either 1, 2 or 3.
-- The stored procedure should perform the following changes:
-- If the employee was rated a 1 - they receive a $10,000 salary increase, additional $300 in
-- bonus and an additional 5% of salary as commission
-- If the employee was rated a 2 - they receive a $5,000 salary increase, additional $200 in
-- bonus and an additional 2% of salary as commission
-- If the employee was rated a 3 - they receive a $2,000 salary increase with no change to their variable pay
-- Make sure you handle two types of errors: (1) A non-existent employee - and - (2) A nonvalid
-- rating. Both should have an appropriate message.
-- The stored procedure should return the employee number, previous compensation and new
-- compensation (all three compensation components showed separately)
-- EMP OLD SALARY OLD BONUS OLD COMM NEW SALARY NEW BONUS NEW COMM
-- Demonstrate that your stored procedure works correctly by running it 5 times: Three times
-- with a valid employee number and a 1 rating, 2 rating and 3 rating. Once with an invalid
-- employee number. Once with an invalid rating level.
-- WHAT TO HAND IN: A copy of your stored procedure and the output of the 5 calls described above.

-- QUESTION 8:
-- Write a stored procedure for the EMPLOYEE table which takes employee number and
-- education level upgrade as input - and - increases the education level of the employee based
-- on the input. Valid input is:
-- "H" (for high school diploma) - and - this will update the edlevel to 16
-- "C" (for college diploma) - and - this will update the edlevel to 19
-- "U" (for university degree) - and - this will update the edlevel to 20
-- "M" (for masters) - and - this will update the edlevel to 23
-- "P" (for PhD) - and - this will update the edlevel to 25
-- Make sure you handle the error condition of incorrect education level input - and - nonexistent employee number
-- Also make sure you never reduce the existing education level of the employee. 
-- They can only stay the same or go up.
-- A message should be provided for all three error cases.
-- When no errors occur, the output should look like:
